## Cygnus
Cygnus was a project that aimed to recreate the CubeWorld experience. The project pivoted towards a focus on tooling for building voxel worlds, managing assets, and tooling for modding.

#### Environment
1. The project is built in Unity3D 5.3.4
2. The project's voxel model rendering is done through PicaVoxel - a voxel engine, with built in editor. However, we use MagicaVoxel models for importing files at runtime. All 3d models you'll find in the game are created using MagicaVoxel.
